This directory holds the failsafe tests. They are articles which absolutely
should work all the time.
Any failiures here should be considered a showstopper (other than the
obvious one of the source article disappearing from the publications
CMS).

In general, these tests are designed to ensure that publications covered
by journalisted.com don't get broken by tweaks :-) But really, they are
all sane(ish) articles which _should_ be parseable.
No room for borderline cases in here.
